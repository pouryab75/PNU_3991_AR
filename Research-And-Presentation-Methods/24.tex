Overall,the best strategy for retrieving useful and relevant information is to use the same tactics that you would use in a library search.First,begin by analyzing your needs.What are you looking for?If the topic is very specific,search engines such as Google will likely result in hits that are relevant and useful.Alternatively,if you are looking for a broad topic,a subject guide such as Yahoo!would likely return the most successful results.Next,conceptualize your search question and then isolate the key-world in the question by eliminating words that are irrelevant.

You may find it useful to use a special purpose search tool that can most accurately meet your needs.Many search tools are designed with specific aims in mind and,as such,thara is not best search tool.Rather,which search tool is best will depend on the kind of search you are doing.The following are a few examples of the different kinds of search tools available with specific aims.
